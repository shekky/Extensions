<!--

This file contains a list of the package IDs which are patching in a given release.

CAUTION: due to limitations in MSBuild, the format of the PackagesInPatch property is picky.
When adding a new package, make sure the new line ends with a semicolon and starts with a space.
Later on, this will be checked using this condition:

    <IsPackageInThisPatch>$(PackagesInPatch.Contains(' $(PackageId);'))</IsPackageInThisPatch>
